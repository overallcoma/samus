This is a concept project to create a sensor with the following features:

1 - Use a MPU to control operational logic (RP2040) 

2 - Use a Wiznet W5500 module for network communications

3 - Use AHT21 for Temperature and Humidity reporting

4 - Use MPU6050 for gyroscopic measurements to detect movement

5 - Report the above metrics via MQTT TLS

The included config.json.example shows an example config.json file with the wiring done on a Seeed Studio XIAO RP2040 MPU
